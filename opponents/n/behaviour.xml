                <state img="#-iNform.png" marker="manifold_ramble">The circle is one of the simplest example of a topological manifold. Topology ignores bending, so a small piece of a circle is treated exactly the same as a small piece of a line. Consider, for instance, the top part of the unit circle, x2 + y2 = 1, where the y-coordinate is positive. So, projection onto the first coordinate is a continuous, and invertible, mapping from the upper arc to the open interval... The formula is X^top, x, y equals X. Such functions, along with the open regions they map, are called charts. Then there's the three-dimensional circle, a sphere, which is also a surface. The unit sphere of implicit equation, x2 + y2 + z2 – 1 = 0, may be covered by an atlas of six charts: the plane z = 0 divides the sphere into two half spheres (z &gt; 0 and z &lt; 0), which may both be mapped on the disc x2 + y2 &lt; 1 by the projection on the xy plane of coordinates. This provides two charts; the four other charts are provided by a similar construction with the two other coordinate planes.</state>
