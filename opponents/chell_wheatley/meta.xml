    <description>Chell is an unwilling test subject for Aperture Science. She is clever and athletic, but most notably she is incredibly tenacious, as well as completely silent. She is accompanied by the personality core Wheatley, a talkative artificial "intelligence" taking the form of a robotic sphere.&lt;br&gt;
