Point is, I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Black Mesa, and I have over &lt;i&gt;three thousand&lt;/i&gt; confirmed accidents. On record. It's a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; list. See, my job was to mess up their research, yeah? Make them make mistakes, and all that. I had a brilliant strategy! See I &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; them catch me, then they spent &lt;i&gt;ages&lt;/i&gt; studying me, learning how to make a sentient machine, instead of doing, er, whatever it was they were doing. Mission success, if I do say so myself. And that's not even the best part! I'm &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; trained in--in information warfare! Designed for it, really, and I'm the top core in Aperture's arsenal. See, you're nothing to me but just another &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt;. I'm dangerous. I'll--I'll &lt;i&gt;hack&lt;/i&gt; anything you care about, anything you can throw at me! I will--I will crash your... your systems with precision the likes of which has never been seen before! Really, so you should, uh, you should be careful. You think you can get away with saying that over the Internet? Because I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; wouldn't do that, if I were you. If I--If I knew what I know. That I'm dangerous. As... as I said earlier. So think again, really. &lt;i&gt;As we speak&lt;/i&gt; I am connecting to your computer, you know, &lt;i&gt;hacking&lt;/i&gt; it, and then--oh boy you really don't want to know. It'll be &lt;i&gt;furious!&lt;/i&gt; If I were you, I'd prepare for the worst, because hoh, it is going to be bad. I mean honestly, you should just run, because I'll wipe you out. Just like that, gone. Dead. Dos Muerte. Because the thing you don't know, really, is that I can be anywhere! At anytime! It's a bit sickening, really, how dangerous I am. I mean if I were you, I would be &lt;i&gt;quaking&lt;/i&gt;. And! It's not even just the one thing, is it? I could get rid of you any number of ways! Actually it's seven hundred, off the top of my head, and that's just hacking! Not &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; am I &lt;i&gt;extensively&lt;/i&gt; trained in, you know, the hacking, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Aperture Science! Premium... Premium access, they gave me. &lt;i&gt;Everything&lt;/i&gt;. Actually, just remembered, they didn't even give it to me! I &lt;i&gt;hacked&lt;/i&gt; it! They're like &lt;i&gt;worms&lt;/i&gt; to me, tiny, insignificant, and I will use them to their full extent to absolutely delete you. Now you may be asking yourself, "why should I be scared if they're like worms?" and you know what? That's a fair point you've got, really, but they're not worms to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. It's just that--that my power is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; great, that even they, the great Aperture Science, are nothing in comparison! So--so think of it that way! Really, if only you could have known what horrible things your little "clever" comment was about to make me do to you, maybe you wouldn't have said that. But you couldn't, could you? You didn't, and now you're--you're going to feel it, really. You... You &lt;i&gt;biological&lt;/i&gt;, uh... human. You being of &lt;i&gt;incomprehensibly tiny&lt;/i&gt; intellect. Except not to me, of course. Absolutely comprehensible, because I'm just &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; smart, just that good at... at comprehending. You will feel my &lt;i&gt;wrath&lt;/i&gt;, and you will wish you had stayed silent. You're dead, mate.</state>

It's never quite clear. During the game, you felt a connection with Chell most of all, and sure enough, when all was said and done, you had followed her back to Aperture Science Laboratories. Wordlessly, she led you to her Extended Relaxation Chamber for... well, why exactly she decided to continue the fun wasn't quite clear. Did she still feel a little frisky? Was this just some stress relief after hours of testing? Or had you caught her eye in a more intimate way?</directive>

Soon enough, you were both nude together, and she beckoned you onto the bed.
